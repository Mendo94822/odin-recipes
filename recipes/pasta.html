    <p>This is a 3 ingredient recipe adding up to a total of 1.02$ per portion. (Well, at least that's the amount I get the ingredients for lol)</p>
    
    <h5>Ingredients:</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>Pasta, (duh) specifically spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Canned tomatoes. (Normal ones are more expensive where I live lol)</li>

    </ul>

            <li>Add Spaghetti to the pot.</li>
            <li>Spaguetti go brrrr</li>
            <li>While the spaghetti cooks, blend the tomatoes and add them to a pan with the meat in low heat.</li>
            <li>When the spaghetti is done after 4 min, add it to the same pan with the meat and tomatoes and change the heat to medium.</li>
